Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository contains a comprehensive example of building a terminal-based Employee Payroll System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Through this project, you'll learn how to design and implement abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and explore inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in Java.

üîç Project Highlights:

Abstract Employee class serving as the foundation for different employee types.
Concrete subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee with salary calculation.
A user-friendly terminal interface for easy interaction and data management.
Demonstrates core OOP concepts with practical coding examples.
